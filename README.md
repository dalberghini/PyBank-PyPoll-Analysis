Resulting scripts from PyBank and PyPoll analysis

PyBank Analysis:
From the results of the 86 months that the profit/loss was taken, the bank gained a total of $38,382,578.
These were not steady gains though. The average monthly profit/loss was $-2,315.12. This shows us a volatily in their buisness model.
Where this volatity is coming from is hard to address without further infomation about the bank's portfolio and income sources. 
Overall the bank is making an average of $446,309 per month over the 86 months though and its outlook looks strong.

PyPoll Analysis:
The results from the election show Khan as the overwhelming winner with 63% of the votes. 
This is 43 points higher than the challenger Correy.
Without access to the voter turnout and demographics of the election only a few assumptions can be made.
First it is likely that Khan is the incumbent and won re-election or that the party that Khan is aligned with is overwhelmingly prevalent in this district.
Secondly, it is likely that O'Tooley, who finished in fourth is a third party candidate. 
Thirdly, it is likely that Correy and Li belong to the same political party and split the vote for that party among the two of them. 
Undecided voters that disagree with or dislike the incumbent candidate or party tend to not be unified and lead to the incumbent being re-elected. 
Once again, these things are assumptions and without further information, the only thing that we can say for certain is that Khan had an overwhelming victory.
